# Project-Euler-Solutions

These are my solutions to the Project Euler problems, from https://projecteuler.net/archives
My solutions are coded in C++, and LUA. I may add other language solutions at a later date.
In case of C++, my solutions are compiled using either Visual Studio, or the online compiler at https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler
